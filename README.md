# Sainsburys-Scraper
Scraper for sainsburys website which returns page information as JSON

This is a maven project, so it will require an installation of maven.

I have run the project through eclipse however if you do not have this or a similar IDE installed then you will have to build/execute through the command line.

External dependencies are gson-2.8.3 & jsoup-1.8.3

Once the application has run, a folder called tmp will appear in the root of the project. In there is the json that the application has outputed.
